# jupyter_notebook_intro
A short introduction to jupyter notebooks

To have a look at the notebook, and get introductions how to set it up locally, 
just click at the **[jupyter_nb_introduction.ipynb](jupyter_nb_introduction.ipynb)** file 
(GitHub should render it automatically)


To try jupyter notebooks **without installing anything locally**, click on the "launch binder" icon above
and wait for the server to complete setting up the environment. 
(this might take a couple of minutes since the python environment etc. has to be set up)

Once it's completed you should arrive at a page looking something like this:

- click on the **jupyter_nb_introduction.ipynpl** file and select **kernel** -> **Restart & Run All** to execute the notebook

- click on the Rise-icon on the right ![Rise-icon](rise_icon.png) to start the notebook as a HTML-presentation
